1. __**The Basics**__

**Command Format**
All Avrae commands follow this format:
`!command argument [optional argument] <required argument>`

An Exclamation point followed by the name of the command you wish to run, then a space and any "arguments" for that command. An argument is typically a modifier for the command you're running.

Arguments surrounded by [square brackets] are optional, while those surrounded by <angled brackets> are required.

Most official Avrae commands (those described in `!help`) have a long and short version. For example you can roll a stealth check by running either `!check stealth` or `!c stealth`. These will be represented in the format `![check|c]`.


**Help**
Avrae will DM you information about the specified command.
`!help <command name>`
ex: `!help check`


**Aliases**
User-made commands for Avrae are known as Aliases. They are used in the same way as any official command, and often contain their own help text accessible with `!aliasname help`.

There are two levels of Alias: Personal Aliases and Server Aliases.

A Personal Alias is one that you have created yourself, copied from another player, or subscribed to on the Avrae Workshop.

A Server Alias is one added at the Server level, which all players on the server can access, whether they have it as a Personal Alias or not.

A Personal Alias will take precedence over a Server Alias, if they are different in any way.


**Snippets**
Similar to an Alias, a Snippet is a User-made argument. Like Aliases, Snippets can be either Personal or Server.


**Lookup**
These commands can be used to look up Items, Spells, Rules, and more.

See `!help` for a full list.


**Common Arguments**
Some arguments that are built into Avrae can be used for many different commands.

Examples include:
`adv` Make a roll with Advantage
`dis` Make a roll with Disadvantage
`ea` Make an attack roll with Elven Accuracy
`-b #` Add a bonus to a roll
`-d #` Add extra damage to a roll
`-rr #` Roll multiple times



2. __**Checks, Saves, Attacks, Spells**__

Note: Many arguments can be abbreviated and Avrae will use the closest match. For example:
!save Dexterity = !save dex

Making an Ability Check
![check|c] <ability|skill> [ability]
ex: !c strength | !c acrobatics | !c nature wisdom

Making a Save
![save|s] <ability>
ex: !s dexterity
