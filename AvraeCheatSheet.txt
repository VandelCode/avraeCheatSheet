1. __**The Basics**__

**Command Format**
All Avrae commands follow this format:
`!command argument [optional argument] <required argument> "argument with spaces"`

An Exclamation point followed by the name of the command you wish to run, then a space and any "arguments" for that command. An argument is typically a modifier for the command you're running.

Arguments surrounded by [square brackets] are optional, while those surrounded by <angled brackets> are required. **Do not include the brackets when you actually run the command**, they are for informational purposes in help text only.

Arguments with spaces (such as spell names) should be wrapped in quotation marks.

Most official Avrae commands (those described in `!help`) have a long and short version. For example you can roll a stealth check by running either `!check stealth` or `!c stealth`. These will be represented in the format `![check|c]`.

**Help**
Avrae will DM you information about the specified command, or general information if no argument is supplied.
`!help`
`!help <command name>`
ex: `!help check`

**Lookup**
These commands can be used to look up Items, Spells, Rules, and more.
`!item <item name>` | `!spell <spell name>` | `!classfeat <class feature>`
See `!help` for a full list.

**Common Arguments**
Some arguments that are built into Avrae can be used for many different commands.

Examples include:
`adv` Make a roll with Advantage
`dis` Make a roll with Disadvantage
`ea` Make an attack roll with Elven Accuracy
`-b #` Add a bonus to a roll
`-d #` Add extra damage to a roll
`-rr #` Roll multiple times (usually Extra Attack)

Common arguments are:
`!cast fireball -l #` (lowercase L) - Casts the spell at given level
`!cast fireball -i` Casts the spell without using a slot, ignoring all other requirements
`!cast hex noconc` Casts the spell without concentration, useful for reapplying spells like Hex that can be moved around

5. __**DM Specific Commands**__

**Begin Combat**
`!i begin`

**Add Monsters to Combat**
`!i madd <monster name> [args]`
Common args include `-n #` to add multiple and `-name <name>` to name the creature(s). Add `#` at the end of the custom name to automatically number them.
ex: `!i madd golin -n 5 -name Goblin#`

**Make Checks and Saves as Monsters**
`!i [check|save] [skill|ability]`
Makes a check as the combatant whose turn it is in initiative.
ex: `!i check perception` | `!i save wis`
To make a save or check for one combatant while it's another combatant's turn, use `!i oc <name> <check>` or `!i os <name> <save>`

**View a Monster's Attacks**
`!i a list`
Shows a list of the current combatant's attacks. If the combatant is a monster, DMs you the list instead of posting in the combat channel.

**Move Initiative**
`!i move [name|initiative count]`
Moves to the specified combatant or initiative count's turn.

`!i prev`
Moves to the previous combatant's turn.

**Remove a Combatant from Initiative**
`!i remove <name>`
Cannot be used on the combatant's turn who is being removed. Dead creatures are removed automatically at the end of their next turn following their death.

**Reroll Initiative**
`!i reroll`
Rerolls the initiative counts of all combatants. Useful for starting a 'new' combat while keeping the same Map loaded (more on this later)

6. __**Combat Maps**__

In combat, the `!map` alias is a powerful tool for keeping track of where combatants are in relation to each other, and can help to immerse players by providing a visual aid.

`!map` is a very complex command and will take some time to learn. See `!map help` for full details. Some basics will be covered below.

__For Players__

**View the Map**
`!map`

**Create and Edit Tokens**
`!map -t <target> [args]` - Edits a token on the map in some way. Args include:
  `-move <coordinate>` - Places a combatant's token or moves it to the specified coordinate
  `-size [T|S|M|L|H|G]` - Sets the size of the combatant's token.
  `-color [color code]` - Sets the color of the token. Color codes can be found in `!map help`.
  `-height <# in feet>` - Sets the token's height, represented by a comment above the map image.

**Generate a Token Image**
`!tokenimport <image URL>` and `!map -t <target> -token <shortcode>`
Generate a 'shortcode' from an image URL, then use that shortcode to add an image to a token.

**Move a Token**
`!move <coordinate> [-t target]`
Moves your character's token to the specified coordinates, or moves the targeted token if `-t` is supplied. Same as running `!map -t <target> -move <coordinate>`

`!go <distance and direction[distance and direction...]> [-t target]`
An interesting command for handling complex movements, or when you know how far and what direction you want to move, but you can't read the map coordinates. Movements can be chained.
ex: `!go 20n` Move your character's token 20 feet north.
ex: `!go 5n5nw10e10s -t goblin` Moves the token "goblin" 5 feet north, 5 feet northwest, 10 feet east, then 10 feet south.

**Adjust the Map View**
`!view <topleft coordinate>:<bottom right coordinate>`
Zooms the map to show only the space between the specified coordinates.

**Display Area Spell Effects**
`!se <name of spell> [aim] [-t target] [-n]`
Creates an Overlay on the map, based on a preset list of spells.
`<name of spell>` Must be enclosed in quotation marks if it includes spaces
`[aim]` is the point where you are placing the overlay, either a coordinate or the name of a creature
`[-t target]` is used in this context to attach the overlay settings to a different combatant than your current one. If for some reason your character creates an overlay when it is not their turn, use this to target your character.
`[-n]` prevents the overlay settings from attaching, useful for showing the area of instantaneous effects like a Fireball.
ex: `!se "Cone of Cold" goblin1 -n` - Displays an overlay for Cone of Cold, emitting from your character's coordinate towards "goblin1's" coordinate. The overlay will not persist the next time the map is shown.
` `

__For DMs__

When setting up a map, you need to have a combatant in initiative for the `!map` alias to save the current setting to.
This combatant must be named any of "Map", "DM", or "Lair".
A common workflow when beginning combat with a map might look like this:
`!i begin` - Start combat
`!i add 0 Map -p 30` - Add a combatant named "Map" at initiative 30
`!map -loadmap Forest` - Loads all the settings for a premade map named "Forest"
Note: `!map -maplist` will show a list of several premade maps, ready to be loaded.

There are far more commands that `!map` can perform than are practical to list here. Browse the `!map help` text, and if you have any questions feel free to ask your fellow DMs.

A good tip for beginners: Start combat in your DM channel and play around with the commands there. Once you have a map set the way you want, you can `!map -savemap <name>`, then start combat in your combat channel and `!map -loadmap <name>`.

7. __**Custom Aliases and Snippets**__

**Aliases**
User-made commands for Avrae are known as Aliases. They are used in the same way as any official command, and often contain their own help text accessible with `!aliasname help`.

There are two levels of Alias: Personal Aliases and Server Aliases.

A Personal Alias is one that you have created yourself, copied from another player, or subscribed to on the Avrae Workshop.

A Server Alias is one added at the Server level, which all players on the server can access, whether they have it as a Personal Alias or not.

A Personal Alias will take precedence over a Server Alias, if they are different in any way.


**Snippets**
Similar to an Alias, a Snippet is a User-made argument. Like Aliases, Snippets can be either Personal or Server.
