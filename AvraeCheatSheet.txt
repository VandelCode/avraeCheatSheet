1. __**The Basics**__

**Command Format**
All Avrae commands follow this format:
`!command argument [optional argument] <required argument> "argument with spaces"`

An Exclamation point followed by the name of the command you wish to run, then a space and any "arguments" for that command. An argument is typically a modifier for the command you're running.

Arguments surrounded by [square brackets] are optional, while those surrounded by <angled brackets> are required. **Do not include the brackets when you actually run the command**, they are for informational purposes in help text only.

Arguments with spaces (such as spell names) should be wrapped in quotation marks.

Most official Avrae commands (those described in `!help`) have a long and short version. For example you can roll a stealth check by running either `!check stealth` or `!c stealth`. These will be represented in the format `![check|c]`.


**Help**
Avrae will DM you information about the specified command, or general information if no argument is supplied..
`!help`
`!help <command name>`
ex: `!help check`



**Lookup**
These commands can be used to look up Items, Spells, Rules, and more.
`!item <item name>` | `!spell <spell name>` | `!classfeat <class feature>`
See `!help` for a full list.


**Common Arguments**
Some arguments that are built into Avrae can be used for many different commands.

Examples include:
`adv` Make a roll with Advantage
`dis` Make a roll with Disadvantage
`ea` Make an attack roll with Elven Accuracy
`-b #` Add a bonus to a roll
`-d #` Add extra damage to a roll
`-rr #` Roll multiple times (usually Extra Attack)



2. __**Character Management**__

**Selecting a Character**
`!char <character name>`

**Update from your Linked Character Sheet**
`!update`

**Modify your HP**
`![game|g] hp [+|-]#`

**Modify Spell Slots**
`![game|g] [spellslot|ss] <slot level> [+|-]#`
ex: `!g ss 2 +1` - Restore one 2nd level slot

**Resting**
`![game|g] [shortrest|sr]`
`![game|g] [longrest|lr]`

3. __**Checks, Saves, Attacks, Spells**__

Note: Many arguments can be abbreviated and Avrae will use the closest match. For example:
`!save Dexterity` = `!save dex`

**Making an Ability Check**
`![check|c] <ability|skill> [ability]`
ex: `!c strength` | `!c acrobatics` | `!c nature wisdom`

**Making a Save**
`![save|s] <ability>`
ex: `!s dexterity`

**Making an Attack**
`![attack|a] <attack name>`
ex: `!a dagger`
Note: `!a list` to show all attacks from your current character.

**Casting a Spell**
`!cast <spell name>`
ex: `!cast "Magic Missile"`

Common arguments are:
`!cast fireball -l #` (lowercase L) - Casts the spell at given level
`!cast fireball -i` Casts the spell without using a slot, ignoring all other requirements
`!cast hex noconc` Casts the spell without concentration, useful for reapplying spells like Hex that can be moved around


4. __**Basic Combat**__

**Joining an Existing Combat**
`![init|i] <join>`
ex: `!i join`

**Attacking a Target**
`![init|i] [attack|a] <attack name> <-t target name>`
ex: `!i a dagger -t goblin`

**Casting a Spell at a Target or Targets**
`![init|i] <cast> <spell name> <-t target name> [-t target name] [-t target name]...`
ex: `!i cast bless -t jim -t billy -t mary`

**Attack of Opportunity**
`![init|i] aoo <attacker> <attack> <-t target>`
ex: `!i aoo jim dagger -t goblin`

**Cast a Spell as a Reaction**
`![init|i] [reactcast|rc] <caster> <spell> [-t target]`
ex: `!i rc billy "hellish rebuke" -t goblin`

**End your Turn**
`![init|i] [next|n]`
__Remember to end your turn when you are done!__




**Aliases**
User-made commands for Avrae are known as Aliases. They are used in the same way as any official command, and often contain their own help text accessible with `!aliasname help`.

There are two levels of Alias: Personal Aliases and Server Aliases.

A Personal Alias is one that you have created yourself, copied from another player, or subscribed to on the Avrae Workshop.

A Server Alias is one added at the Server level, which all players on the server can access, whether they have it as a Personal Alias or not.

A Personal Alias will take precedence over a Server Alias, if they are different in any way.


**Snippets**
Similar to an Alias, a Snippet is a User-made argument. Like Aliases, Snippets can be either Personal or Server.
